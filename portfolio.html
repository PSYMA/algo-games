                My name is Rickben Anthony Q. Gimeda, I started my programming career in 2018,
                It was during my second year in Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program. I struggle
                a lot in programming course but soon enough I started to like it, like how much I can do in programming
                field. Then soon after I decided to take the path of being a programmer.
            </p><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 10%;">
                I have made a couple of projects written in C++ and C# as part of my practice, I have studied more about
                Object Oriented Programming and Data structure and Algorithms. My latest creation is the website itself.
                As part of my goal I'm currently working to make myself a fine developer hoping to get my dream job as a
                software developer soon.

                <p>
                    The Puzzle Game is the last C# project I created. It was during early lockdown of March 2020,
                    due to boredom I decided to create this. The game is the same as a typical puzzle game. You
                    will
                    just need
                    to put everything in order for you to win.

                <p>
                    This Tic Tac Toe Game is my prelim project during my C# language course in college, this is not
                    your
                    traditional tic tac toe game, the game itself has more features and is way more graphical. The
                    rules
                    are
                    the
                    same.

                <p>
                    This Matching Game is my midterm project during my C# language course in college, the game works
                    by
                    pairing
                    its cell to the other cell, make mistakes and it will reduce your HP when HP goes to zero you
                    lose.

                    This Hidden Battle Game is my final project during my C# language course in college, The game is
                    derived from this board game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gHJlYLomrs" target="_blank"
                        style="color: #004daa;">link</a>.
                    this is the most challenging project I created in C# so far took me a lot of time to finished.

                    This is one of my very first project back in my early days in programming C language in particular,
                    The is game quite simple all you need to do is to control the paddle and catch the ball, make sure
                    to catch the ball otherwise you will lose. clear all stars and you win.

                <p>
                    This Simple Library System is my final project during my C language course. I struggle a lot during
                    my creation of this project, I am still a newbie at that time. The project is quite easy: student
                    borrow books as well return it.

                <p>
                    This Library System is the upgraded version of my Simple Library System in C++,
                    it's integrated with SQLite and offers a couple of features and it's graphical and user friendly.
                    I decided to create this project to expose myself in a database project.
